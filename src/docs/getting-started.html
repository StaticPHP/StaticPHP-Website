	<h3>Step One: Download and Install</h3>
	<p>Download the latest version to your project folder/directory. It is recommended to download the launcher, as this will keep you up to date with the latest StaticPHP features, as well as give you easy customisation options.</p>

	<h3>Step Two: Develop Your Website</h3>
	<p>Start creating HTML and PHP files and let StaticPHP do the rest. If using any file paths, such as those for including other files, these need to be relative to where the StaticPHP file is.</p>
	<p>Read about the <a href="/docs/metadata">MetaData</a> feature for more you can do with your website files.</p>
