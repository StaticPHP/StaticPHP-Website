<p>For more advanced sites that could benefit from things like loops and conditionals etc will need to use <a href="/docs/php-files">PHP files</a>, but if your site is even simplier, then you just need HTML.</p>

<p>StaticPHP takes away the headache of using HTML files with a static site. You still need PHP for running StaticPHP, but you don't need to write any PHP code for your site during development.</p>

<p>Combining StaticPHP's <a href="/docs/metadata">MetaData</a> feature with HTML files gives you the power to develop your site using only HTML files without any PHP, and best of all, no headache that comes with HTML files.</p>
